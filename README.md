# Personal-Portfolio
I developed a responsive portfolio using React and Tailwind CSS. The portfolio adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on both desktop and mobile devices. Utilizing Tailwind's utility-first approach and React's component-based architecture, I created a visually appealing and functional showcase of my skills and projects.
